# Version 4

## Updation from last repo

Added some missing functionalities of the "TeamLeader" and "TeamMembers"

### Crucial Error Fixing

- From the start these was a crucial error in the if of all collections it wasn't able to excede the value of 10 but when it did excede the value of two digits there were still some errors.
- to fix this error adeed the digits bounding of "5" zeros to the id of each collection now rather then starting from "1" they start from "00001".
